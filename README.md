# Predicting Activity of Short Antimicrobial Peptides through Physico-chemical Properties of the Whole Protein
Our aim is to design a random forest model to predict the activity of short antimicrobial peptides by choosing physicochemical properties as the input feature. We also aim to find the most relevant features required to build our model.
