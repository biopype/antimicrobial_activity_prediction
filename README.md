# Predicting Activity of Short Antimicrobial Peptides through Physico-chemical Properties of the Whole Protein
We design a random forest model to predict the activity of short antimicrobial peptides by choosing physicochemical properties as the input feature. We also aim to find the most relevant features required to build the model.
